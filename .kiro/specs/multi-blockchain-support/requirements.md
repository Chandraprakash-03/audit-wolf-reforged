# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature extends the existing Audit Wolf platform to support smart contract analysis across multiple blockchain ecosystems beyond Solidity/Ethereum. The multi-blockchain support will enable users to analyze contracts written in different programming languages and deployed on various blockchain networks including Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain, Polygon, Avalanche, Solana, Cardano, and others. The implementation must maintain backward compatibility with the existing Solidity analysis pipeline while introducing a modular architecture that can accommodate different contract languages, static analysis tools, and blockchain-specific security patterns.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a multi-chain developer, I want to select the blockchain platform when uploading contracts, so that I can receive platform-specific security analysis for my smart contracts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user accesses the contract upload interface THEN the system SHALL provide a blockchain platform selector with supported networks
2. WHEN a user selects a blockchain platform THEN the system SHALL display platform-specific file format requirements and validation rules
3. WHEN uploading contracts THEN the system SHALL validate file extensions and syntax according to the selected blockchain platform
4. WHEN multiple blockchain platforms are selected THEN the system SHALL support cross-chain contract analysis for interoperability projects
5. IF an unsupported blockchain is requested THEN the system SHALL display available alternatives and roadmap information

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security auditor, I want the platform to automatically detect contract languages and apply appropriate analysis tools, so that I can audit contracts across different blockchain ecosystems with consistent quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN contracts are uploaded THEN the system SHALL automatically detect the programming language (Solidity, Rust, Move, Plutus, etc.)
2. WHEN language detection completes THEN the system SHALL select appropriate static analysis tools for each contract type
3. WHEN analyzing Solana contracts THEN the system SHALL integrate with Rust-based security tools and Anchor framework validation
4. WHEN analyzing Cardano contracts THEN the system SHALL support Plutus script analysis and UTXO model validation
5. WHEN analyzing Move contracts THEN the system SHALL integrate with Move Prover and resource-oriented security checks
6. WHEN multiple contract types are present THEN the system SHALL coordinate analysis across different toolchains

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a blockchain project manager, I want to receive blockchain-specific vulnerability assessments, so that I can understand platform-unique security risks and optimization opportunities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing Ethereum contracts THEN the system SHALL check for EVM-specific vulnerabilities (reentrancy, gas optimization, MEV risks)
2. WHEN analyzing Solana contracts THEN the system SHALL validate account model security, program derived addresses, and compute unit optimization
3. WHEN analyzing Cardano contracts THEN the system SHALL verify UTXO handling, datum validation, and Plutus script efficiency
4. WHEN analyzing BSC contracts THEN the system SHALL include BEP token standard compliance and cross-chain bridge security
5. WHEN analyzing Layer 2 contracts THEN the system SHALL validate rollup-specific patterns and state management
6. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL include blockchain-specific best practices and compliance requirements

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a DeFi protocol developer, I want to analyze cross-chain contracts and bridges, so that I can ensure security across multiple blockchain networks in my interoperability solutions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN uploading cross-chain projects THEN the system SHALL support analysis of contract sets spanning multiple blockchains
2. WHEN analyzing bridge contracts THEN the system SHALL validate cross-chain message passing and asset locking mechanisms
3. WHEN checking interoperability THEN the system SHALL identify potential inconsistencies in cross-chain state management
4. WHEN validating multi-chain deployments THEN the system SHALL ensure consistent security properties across all target networks
5. WHEN generating cross-chain reports THEN the system SHALL highlight network-specific risks and deployment considerations

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want to configure and manage multiple blockchain analysis pipelines, so that I can maintain high-quality auditing services as new blockchain platforms emerge.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN new blockchain support is added THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of platform-specific analysis tools without affecting existing pipelines
2. WHEN managing analysis tools THEN the system SHALL provide health monitoring and version management for each blockchain's toolchain
3. WHEN processing queues THEN the system SHALL balance load across different blockchain analysis pipelines efficiently
4. WHEN tool updates are available THEN the system SHALL support rolling updates without service interruption
5. WHEN blockchain networks upgrade THEN the system SHALL maintain compatibility with both legacy and updated contract versions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a smart contract developer, I want to compare security analysis results across different blockchain implementations, so that I can make informed decisions about deployment targets.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN analyzing equivalent contracts on different blockchains THEN the system SHALL provide comparative security assessments
2. WHEN displaying results THEN the system SHALL highlight platform-specific advantages and trade-offs
3. WHEN generating recommendations THEN the system SHALL suggest optimal blockchain platforms based on contract requirements
4. WHEN cost analysis is performed THEN the system SHALL include transaction fees and deployment costs for each supported blockchain
5. WHEN performance metrics are calculated THEN the system SHALL estimate throughput and latency characteristics per platform

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As an enterprise user, I want to maintain audit trails and compliance reporting across multiple blockchain deployments, so that I can meet regulatory requirements for multi-chain operations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audits are completed THEN the system SHALL maintain detailed logs of analysis tools and versions used for each blockchain
2. WHEN compliance reporting is required THEN the system SHALL generate blockchain-specific regulatory compliance assessments
3. WHEN audit history is accessed THEN the system SHALL provide filtering and search capabilities by blockchain platform
4. WHEN exporting audit data THEN the system SHALL support standardized formats for regulatory submission
5. WHEN data retention policies apply THEN the system SHALL manage multi-blockchain audit records according to jurisdiction requirements

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a security researcher, I want to access blockchain-specific vulnerability databases and threat intelligence, so that I can leverage the latest security knowledge for each platform during analysis.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN performing analysis THEN the system SHALL integrate with blockchain-specific vulnerability databases (e.g., Ethereum Security Database, Solana Security Best Practices)
2. WHEN new threats are discovered THEN the system SHALL update detection rules for affected blockchain platforms
3. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL reference relevant CVEs and security advisories for each blockchain
4. WHEN threat intelligence is updated THEN the system SHALL re-evaluate recent audits and notify users of new findings
5. WHEN custom rules are needed THEN the system SHALL allow configuration of platform-specific detection patterns
