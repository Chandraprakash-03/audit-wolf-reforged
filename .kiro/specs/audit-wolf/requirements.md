# Requirements Document

## Introduction

Audit Wolf is a comprehensive smart contract auditing platform that combines AI-powered analysis with traditional static analysis tools to provide detailed security assessments of Solidity contracts. The platform enables users to upload or paste smart contracts and receive professional audit reports covering vulnerabilities, gas optimizations, and best practices. The system leverages multiple AI models through LangChain and OpenRouter, integrates with static analysis tools like Slither, and provides a modern web interface built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a smart contract developer, I want to upload or paste Solidity code for analysis, so that I can receive comprehensive security audits of my contracts.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user visits the platform THEN the system SHALL provide options to paste code or upload .sol files
2. WHEN a user pastes Solidity code THEN the system SHALL validate the code syntax before processing
3. WHEN a user uploads a .sol file THEN the system SHALL accept files up to 10MB in size
4. WHEN multiple contracts are provided THEN the system SHALL support analysis of interconnected contract dependencies
5. IF invalid Solidity code is submitted THEN the system SHALL display clear error messages with syntax guidance

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a security auditor, I want the platform to perform comprehensive static and AI-powered analysis, so that I can identify vulnerabilities and optimization opportunities with high accuracy.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an audit is initiated THEN the system SHALL run Slither static analysis on the submitted contracts
2. WHEN static analysis completes THEN the system SHALL perform AST parsing for code structure analysis
3. WHEN AI analysis begins THEN the system SHALL use multiple LLMs through OpenRouter for vulnerability detection
4. WHEN AI models analyze code THEN the system SHALL check for common vulnerabilities (reentrancy, overflow, access control)
5. WHEN analysis is complete THEN the system SHALL combine static and AI results into a unified assessment
6. IF analysis fails THEN the system SHALL provide detailed error logs and retry mechanisms

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a contract owner, I want to receive detailed audit reports with actionable recommendations, so that I can improve my contract's security and efficiency.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN audit analysis completes THEN the system SHALL generate a structured report with executive summary
2. WHEN generating reports THEN the system SHALL categorize findings by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low, Informational)
3. WHEN vulnerabilities are found THEN the system SHALL provide specific code locations and remediation steps
4. WHEN gas optimizations are identified THEN the system SHALL include estimated gas savings and implementation guidance
5. WHEN reports are ready THEN the system SHALL export them as professional PDF documents
6. WHEN PDF generation completes THEN the system SHALL send reports via email using Senderwolf integration

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want to access a dashboard to manage my audit history and reports, so that I can track my security improvements over time.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user logs in THEN the system SHALL display a dashboard with audit history
2. WHEN viewing the dashboard THEN the system SHALL show audit status, dates, and report summaries
3. WHEN users search audits THEN the system SHALL provide filtering by date, contract name, and severity
4. WHEN users click on past audits THEN the system SHALL allow re-downloading of PDF reports
5. WHEN audit metadata is stored THEN the system SHALL maintain records in Supabase database
6. IF IPFS storage is enabled THEN the system SHALL optionally store report hashes on blockchain

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a platform administrator, I want the system to handle multiple concurrent audits reliably, so that the platform can scale to serve many users simultaneously.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN multiple audits are submitted THEN the system SHALL queue and process them efficiently
2. WHEN system load increases THEN the system SHALL maintain response times under 30 seconds for audit initiation
3. WHEN processing audits THEN the system SHALL provide real-time progress updates to users
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL implement retry logic and graceful error handling
5. WHEN new analysis tools are available THEN the system SHALL support modular integration without downtime

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a platform user, I want an intuitive and professional interface, so that I can easily navigate the auditing process and understand results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users access the platform THEN the system SHALL provide a modern, responsive design using Tailwind CSS and Shadcn UI
2. WHEN users interact with the interface THEN the system SHALL support both dark and light themes
3. WHEN navigation occurs THEN the system SHALL provide smooth animations and transitions
4. WHEN displaying audit results THEN the system SHALL use clear visualizations and color coding for severity levels
5. WHEN users are on mobile devices THEN the system SHALL maintain full functionality with responsive design
6. IF accessibility features are needed THEN the system SHALL comply with WCAG 2.1 guidelines

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a security-conscious user, I want my contracts and audit data to be stored securely with proper authentication, so that my intellectual property remains protected.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN users register THEN the system SHALL implement secure authentication via Supabase Auth
2. WHEN contracts are uploaded THEN the system SHALL encrypt sensitive data at rest
3. WHEN audit reports are generated THEN the system SHALL ensure only authorized users can access their reports
4. WHEN data is transmitted THEN the system SHALL use HTTPS encryption for all communications
5. WHEN users delete accounts THEN the system SHALL provide complete data removal options
6. IF blockchain storage is used THEN the system SHALL only store non-sensitive metadata on-chain
