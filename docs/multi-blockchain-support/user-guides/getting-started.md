# Getting Started with Multi-Blockchain Analysis

Welcome to Audit Wolf's multi-blockchain smart contract analysis platform. This guide will help you get started with analyzing contracts across different blockchain ecosystems.

## Overview

Audit Wolf supports comprehensive security analysis for smart contracts across multiple blockchain platforms, including:

- **Ethereum & EVM Chains** (Solidity)
- **Solana** (Rust/Anchor)
- **Cardano** (Plutus/Haskell)
- **Move-based Chains** (Aptos/Sui)

## Quick Start Guide

### Step 1: Access the Platform

1. Log in to your Audit Wolf account
2. Navigate to the "New Audit" section
3. You'll see the multi-blockchain interface with platform selection options

### Step 2: Select Blockchain Platform

Choose your target blockchain platform(s):

- **Single Platform**: Select one blockchain for focused analysis
- **Multi-Platform**: Select multiple platforms for comparative analysis
- **Cross-Chain**: Enable cross-chain analysis for bridge contracts and interoperability projects

### Step 3: Upload Contracts

#### For Single Contracts:

1. Click "Upload Contract"
2. Select your blockchain platform
3. Upload your contract file(s)
4. The system will automatically detect the programming language

#### For Multi-Contract Projects:

1. Click "Upload Project"
2. Select multiple platforms if needed
3. Upload all related contract files
4. Organize contracts by platform if cross-chain analysis is required

### Step 4: Configure Analysis Options

#### Basic Analysis Options:

- **Static Analysis**: Enable platform-specific static analysis tools
- **AI Analysis**: Use AI models trained on blockchain-specific patterns
- **Security Checks**: Run comprehensive security vulnerability detection
- **Gas/Performance Analysis**: Analyze efficiency and optimization opportunities

#### Advanced Options:

- **Cross-Chain Analysis**: Analyze bridge contracts and interoperability
- **Comparative Analysis**: Compare the same logic across different platforms
- **Custom Rules**: Apply custom security rules for your project

### Step 5: Review Results

Once analysis is complete, you'll receive:

1. **Platform-Specific Reports**: Detailed analysis for each blockchain
2. **Vulnerability Assessment**: Security issues categorized by severity
3. **Optimization Recommendations**: Performance and cost improvements
4. **Cross-Chain Analysis** (if enabled): Interoperability security assessment

## Understanding Analysis Results

### Vulnerability Severity Levels

- **Critical**: Immediate security risks requiring urgent attention
- **High**: Significant security concerns that should be addressed
- **Medium**: Important issues that may impact security or functionality
- **Low**: Minor issues and optimization opportunities
- **Informational**: Best practice recommendations and code quality suggestions

### Platform-Specific Insights

Each blockchain platform provides unique insights:

- **Ethereum**: Gas optimization, MEV protection, ERC standard compliance
- **Solana**: Account model security, PDA validation, compute unit optimization
- **Cardano**: UTXO handling, datum validation, Plutus script efficiency
- **Move**: Resource safety, formal verification results, module security

## Best Practices

### Before Analysis

1. **Prepare Complete Codebase**: Include all dependencies and related contracts
2. **Choose Appropriate Platform**: Consider your deployment targets
3. **Enable Relevant Options**: Select analysis features that match your needs
4. **Review Platform Requirements**: Check platform-specific prerequisites

### During Analysis

1. **Monitor Progress**: Track analysis status for each platform
2. **Review Intermediate Results**: Some platforms may provide partial results
3. **Check for Errors**: Address any upload or configuration issues promptly

### After Analysis

1. **Prioritize Critical Issues**: Address high-severity vulnerabilities first
2. **Review Platform Recommendations**: Consider blockchain-specific suggestions
3. **Compare Results**: Use comparative analysis for multi-platform projects
4. **Plan Remediation**: Create an action plan based on findings

## Common Use Cases

### Single Platform Development

Perfect for projects targeting a specific blockchain:

1. Upload contracts for your target platform
2. Enable comprehensive analysis options
3. Focus on platform-specific optimizations
4. Use detailed security recommendations

### Multi-Platform Deployment

Ideal for projects deploying across multiple chains:

1. Upload equivalent contracts for each platform
2. Enable comparative analysis
3. Review platform-specific trade-offs
4. Optimize for each blockchain's characteristics

### Cross-Chain Projects

Essential for bridge contracts and interoperability:

1. Upload contracts for all involved platforms
2. Enable cross-chain analysis
3. Focus on bridge security and state consistency
4. Review interoperability risks
